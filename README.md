Description of the Employee Payroll System Project This project is a Java-based console based employee payroll system.

Implementing Object-Oriented Programming features, including classes, objects, constructors, method overloading, encapsulation, file handling, and exception handling, is the primary goal of this project. 

The user can search employees, add employees, compute wage components, and use file handling to permanently save employee data.

Goals: To use Java to develop a payroll system. To use OOP principles in practical applications. To determine net salary, DA, and HRA. To serialize and store employee data. To incorporate the ability to search. 

Utilized Technologies: 
Java and OOP Principles File management, the framework for collections, and features for handling exceptions.
1. Add a Worker 
2. Show Every Employee 
3. Look Up Employees by ID 
4. Salary Calculation Automatically
   5. Information kept in a file

Salary Logic Calculation 
HRA is equal to 20% of base pay. 10% of Basic Salary is the DA. Basic + HRA + DA = Net Salary --- Utilized OOP Concepts Class and Object+ Default and parameterized constructors The Overloading of Methods-
 Encapsulation Serialization The Management of Files Handling Exceptions 
Project Management 
1. Launch Eclipse and open the project. 
2. Launch the file `Main.java`. 
3. Select dishes from the menu.
4. When you exit, data will be immediately saved. 
5. Final Thoughts I gained a better understanding of how actual payroll systems operate because to this effort. It improved my comprehension of Java file handling and OOP principles. This project taught me how to effectively handle personnel data and save objects using serialization.
